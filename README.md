# Typing Speed Calculator 
  
  
We were assigned by ***Varcons Technologies Pvt. Ltd.*** to Write a Java code for calculating the speed of typing, as for our internship project. It was an interesting task for the team as it gave us the opportunity to test our skills of Java. We as a team started to create the algorithms and logic to find the solutions. During the process we hit some dead ends where we had to get assisted by the skilled trainer who was assigned to us. 
We had to follow the trial and error method to find the appropriate solution. The interesting part is that the mistakes which we made during the process was the key ingredient for our final code.
The main advantage of this project was that we learnt how to work together as a team and find solutions to problems that are given to us.
Also, we had a great opportunity to learn a new programming language which can be of great asset in our professional lives.


## Execution 
The program was coded in jdk version 15 to be able to run it in maximum machines... 

The code consists of two classes: 

> Main.java \
> Challenge.java

The Main.java class consists of the *main* function which is basically the front-end of the program. It has a menu like prompt, that takes in an integer, if any invalid integer or character is passed, it restarts the code to show prompt again to enter correct option.

Challenge.java class consists of the back-end part of the code, it outputs the user's desired level of challenge which is chosen from the above prompt. The user gets to choose 4 levels of difficulty, *viz.*, **Easy**, **Medium**, **Hard** and **Custom**. The first 3 levels of the four, has fixed number of words printed randomly from it's respective array of strings, namely, *easywords*, *words* and *hardwords* respectively. 

 **Easy** level prints 8 words, from *easywords* array \
 **Medium** level prints 11 words, from *words* array \
 **Hard** level prints 15 words, from *hardwords* array

As an added feature, it also has an option to do a **Custom** level challenge which asks for number of words, which will be printed as random pool of words from each of the array of strings of different levels.
